  "bio": "I began with the weight of forgotten bodies, fragmented memories, forms wrapped in silence, shaped by absence and displacement. But over time, the materials began to speak of something vaster. Stone, born in stars, reminded me that we too are cosmic debris, scattered and searching.\n\nNow, my work looks upward as much as inward, linking the fractured human form to constellations of time, grief, and origin. What was once about loss has become about scale. About remembering we have always belonged to something far beyond ourselves.",
